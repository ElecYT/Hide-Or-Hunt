# Hide-Or-Hunt
A minecraft minigame involving beacons for Nautical Network
# Game mechanics
Each player selects a team to be on, and then the game starts. Once the game starts, each team must place a beacon. The beacon is their respawn anchor, so they must protect it at all costs. Fireworks will be launched on the 500 x 500 map to reveal people's beacons. 
# Game end
The game ends when the last person is killed, and one person remains.
